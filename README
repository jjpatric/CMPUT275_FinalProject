Game Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This game is loosely based off of the flash game that goes by
the same name, if you would like to get a better understanding
of the mechanics, it might be a good idea to check out.

Startup:
    
    * When the arduino and server program are running, they
      should perform a TCP handshake to establish connections.

    * If the handshake is successful, you will be taken to the
      main menu. Select your desired mode by selecting with
       the move button and confirming with the action button.

    * Once a mode is selected, you will be taken to the map
      menu, where you can select one of four different maps
      to play on. Select the desired map by selectind with 
      the move button and confirming with the action button.

    * The selected map will load and appear on the tft display
      and the game will start with Player 1.

Gameplay:
    
    * The object of the game is to take over all of your
      opponent's buildings.

    * Each player starts with a set number of buildings
      determined by the map data(red or blue).  There are 
      also neutral buildings (white) you can take over to
       gain an advantage

    * Each building is represented by a colored rectangle on
      the tft display. Inside the rectangle is a character 
      representing its maximum size (B = 10, P = 25, H = 50)
      followed by a positive integer representing the current
      number of units contained in the building.

    * This game is turn-based. On a given player's turn, they
      may select any number of buildings they control, then 
      send half the total units in the selected buildings
      to a selected target. 

    * The units take a certain number of turns to reach their 
      destination depending on how far away the building they
      originate from is.  When a unit reaches its target, it
      adds or subtracts its total strength from the unit count
      in the target building.

    * If a building's unit count reaches zero, control of 
      that building is forfeited to the player who attacked
      the building last. The building then shoots up to its 
      maximum value if the building is neutral.

    * Play continues until one player has full control
      of the map.

Controls:
    * On your turn, move the cursor using the Move button,
      the building will have a yellow highlight.
      You can select and deselect buildings by pressing
      the Select button while on a highlighted building.
      A white highlight will appear around the building.

    * You can select as many buildings that you own as you
      want.  When you're finished, press the Action button
      to confirm your choices. You then select a building 
      on the map to send your units to by moving the cursor
      with the Move button and confirm with the Action button.

    * In short,
      Phase 1: Select buildings that you want to send units
      from.
      Phase 2: Select one building you want to send those
      units to.
